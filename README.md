# MES-WordPress
Wordpress theme for the Mind's Eye Society website.

## Development environment
The recommended environment for WP development is using [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV). Before running `vagrant up`, do the following commands:

```bash
mkdir [[VVV_ROOT]]/www/mes.dev
cd www/mes.dev
git clone https://github.com/MindsEyeSociety/MES-WordPress.git mindseyesociety
```

This will allow VVV to correctly install and move everything to it's proper spots. To access the site after install, go to `mes.dev`.
